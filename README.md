"# AI-ASL-HMM" 
"Built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). 
Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video to try and identify individual words from test sequences. 
Experimented with model selection techniques including BIC, DIC, and K-fold Cross Validation"
